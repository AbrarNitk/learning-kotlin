# @Composable

Composable functions are a fundamental concept in Jetpack Compose, which is a modern 
UI toolkit introduced by Google for building native Android user interfaces.

When using the @Composable annotation, the function can take input parameters and return 
UI elements, and it is intended to be a pure function without side effects.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SimpleTextComponent(text: String) {
    Text(
        text = text,
        style = TextStyle(fontSize = 18.sp, fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold)
    )
}
```
